POSIX-SchedYield

This module exposes the POSIX system call sched_yield(2) to Perl
programs. For further details please see the perldoc in
lib/POSIX/SchedYield.pm.

INSTALLATION

To install this module you require a working POSIX environment and a
C compiler. OpenBSD is not supported, since that OS seems to lack an
implementation of sched_yield(). So far, the module has been tested
successfully on i686 Linux, FreeBSD 6.0 and OS X, please email the
author if you installed it (or ran into problems) in a different
environment. 

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following
commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
